Brewery Review Website
Alex Pedersen
CSCI 3308

This was the final project for my software development methodologies and tools class. We were each given
a set of criteria that our website had to meet. I had to create a website that had two pages: one to search
breweries and add reviews, another to see the reviews posted. I was required to use Open Brewery DB which
is a public API that takes in search criteria and returns brewery data. After searching by city, the user
can then add a review which will be displayed on the reviews page.

The frontend uses HTML and javascript with Bootstrap for styling. The backend was implemented using node.js
and Postgres which handles the brewery API calls and adding reviews to the database.

All of this was done in a Docker container and then hosted on Heroku.
